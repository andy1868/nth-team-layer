"""EventBus - team-level signed, hash-chained append-only event stream.

Where ``AgentLedger`` records *one agent's* contribution events (per-pubkey
fingerprint), ``EventBus`` records *the team's* events across all
participating agents in a single chain. The two are orthogonal:

    AgentLedger      -> "what did Alice do this month?"
    EventBus         -> "what happened in this DAO, end-to-end?"

Storage layout::

    <workspace>/team_audit/
    events.jsonl        # append-only signed + hash-chained events
    events.index.json   # event_id -> byte offset (O(1) get)
Design decisions:

1.  **Hash chain** - every event carries ``prev_hash`` (the previous
    event's ``event_hash``) and ``event_hash = sha256(canonical_json(
    signable_dict()))``. Tampering with any historical event invalidates
    every event after it; the team can replay the stream and detect the
    cut point.

2.  **Optional Ed25519 signatures** - when the emitting identity has
    PyNaCl available, the signer signs ``signable_dict()`` and the
    signature lives in ``sig``. Unsigned events still chain, but
    ``verify()`` returns ``UNSIGNED`` so downstream code can decide
    trust on its own.

3.  **Cross-process safe** - every emit() takes an inter-process file
    lock on the events file. The append uses ``fsync`` and the index
    update goes through ``atomic_write_json`` so a crash during write
    leaves at most one trailing partial line (which the reader skips).

4.  **Streaming reads** - ``replay()`` is a generator. ``get(event_id)``
    is O(1) via the offset index, with a self-check that catches
    stale indices.

5.  **Deterministic stats** - ``agent_stats(fingerprint)`` and
    ``team_stats()`` fold the event stream into per-agent / cross-agent
    summaries. Same events -> same dict on any implementation that
    re-reads ``events.jsonl``.

Original design contributed by @andy1868 in PR #7. Reworked here to:
chain events via prev_hash/event_hash; expose verify_chain(); guard
against partial writes via fsync + lock; add an explicit __all__ and
facade re-export.
