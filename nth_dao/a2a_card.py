"""A2A Protocol Agent Card emission for NTH DAO nodes (2026-06-08).

Strategic alignment (L0-2 in the roadmap): NTH DAO already publishes a
signed identity card at ``/.well-known/nth-dao/identity.json``. The
shape is NTH-native (``kind: nth-dao-identity-card-v1`` + flat ``sig``
field). The A2A Protocol — adopted by 50+ enterprise partners
including Atlassian, Cohere, PayPal, Salesforce, SAP — has a different
canonical shape published at ``/.well-known/agent.json`` and signed
with JWS-style ``signatures[]`` envelopes per RFC 7515.

This module emits an A2A-compatible AgentCard derived from the SAME
identity material so:

  * NTH peers continue to use the native card (no churn for the
    in-house ecosystem)
  * A2A consumers (LangChain / Cohere / Salesforce / …) can fetch
    ``/.well-known/agent.json`` and treat the NTH node as a regular
    A2A participant
  * Both documents reference the same Ed25519 keypair, so a consumer
    that learned the pubkey from one channel can verify the other

The A2A AgentCard schema is the canonical Protocol Buffer definition
at ``a2aproject/A2A`` ``specification/a2a.proto`` (commit at fetch
time on 2026-06-08). Quoted required fields:

  string name                          [REQUIRED]
  string description                   [REQUIRED]
  repeated AgentInterface supported_interfaces [REQUIRED]
  string version                       [REQUIRED]
  AgentCapabilities capabilities       [REQUIRED]
  repeated string default_input_modes  [REQUIRED]
  repeated string default_output_modes [REQUIRED]
  repeated AgentSkill skills           [REQUIRED]
  AgentProvider provider               [optional]
  optional string documentation_url
  map<string, SecurityScheme> security_schemes
  repeated SecurityRequirement security_requirements
  repeated AgentCardSignature signatures
  optional string icon_url

Signature envelope (AgentCardSignature):

  string protected   [REQUIRED]  — base64url(JWS protected header JSON)
  string signature   [REQUIRED]  — base64url(Ed25519_sign over input)
  google.protobuf.Struct header   [optional]  — unprotected header

Signing input (RFC 7515 JWS Compact serialization without payload —
"detached payload" mode):

  signing_input = base64url(protected_header_json) + "." +
                  base64url(canonical_json(card_without_signatures))

We choose detached-payload mode rather than embedding the payload
inside the JWS string because the card document IS the payload — the
verifier already has it.

Algorithm: ``EdDSA`` per RFC 8037. ``kid`` carries the did:key of the
signing keypair so a consumer with the DID can derive the pubkey
locally and verify without an external resolver.

Forward compatibility:
  * ``skills`` currently surface the local home channel ID as a
    placeholder skill — future revisions should enumerate group
    capabilities and registered tool surfaces.
  * ``capabilities.streaming = false`` until we wire SSE.
  * ``security_schemes`` only declares the console Bearer scheme for
    privileged calls; the public card itself is unauthenticated by
    contract.
