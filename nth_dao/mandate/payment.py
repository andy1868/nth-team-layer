"""PaymentMandate - the ACCEPTANCE half that closes the Mandate triad.

After:
  1. The DAO signed an IntentMandate authorising agent X to spend Y
  2. The counterparty signed a CartMandate offering goods at price Z
     bound to that intent's digest

...the DAO signs a PaymentMandate accepting the cart and committing to
a specific settlement rail. The triad is now complete:

  IntentMandate  -- authorises  -->  agent
  CartMandate    -- offers      -->  goods at price
  PaymentMandate -- accepts     -->  settles via chosen rail

The PaymentMandate is the signal a SettlementAdapter (x402, AP2 card,
manual, etc.) listens for. Its presence + its three binding checks
(payment->cart->intent) prove every external requirement was met:

  * The DAO authorised this purpose (intent)
  * The counterparty offered these terms (cart)
  * Both sides accept the specific settlement rail (payment)

Why proofPurpose=capabilityInvocation?
    Like IntentMandate, PaymentMandate is a DELEGATION - the DAO
    delegates settlement authority to the named SettlementAdapter for
    this specific cart. capabilityInvocation is the canonical VC Data
    Integrity proof purpose for delegations. CartMandate's
    assertionMethod (an offer being made) is semantically different;
    keeping them distinct prevents callers from confusing an offer
    with an authorisation.

Three-stage check chain (the end-to-end gate):

  1. verify_intent_mandate(intent)
     -> intent is authentic and signed by the DAO

  2. verify_cart_mandate(cart) AND cart_satisfies_intent(cart, intent)
     -> cart is authentic AND fits within the intent's constraints

  3. verify_payment_mandate(payment) AND
     payment_satisfies_cart(payment, cart) AND
     payment.issuer == intent.issuer
     -> payment is authentic AND picks an offered settlement rail
        AND is from the same DAO that issued the intent

complete_triad_chain(intent, cart, payment) does all of this in one
call for callers who don't want to compose manually.
