"""IntentMandate - the AUTHORISATION half of the Mandate triad.

An IntentMandate is the DAO (or human) saying:

    "I authorise agent X to spend up to Y, with counterparties from
     this list, by these settlement methods, until this date."

It's a W3C Verifiable Credential 2.0 (data-model JSON form), signed
with Ed25519Signature2020 over canonical JSON. Shape mirrors AP2's
Intent mandate verbatim so an AP2 facilitator can consume it without
custom code.

        "proofPurpose": "capabilityInvocation",
        "proofValue": "<128-hex Ed25519 sig>"
      }
    }

Why proofPurpose="capabilityInvocation"?
    Per VC Data Integrity, capabilityInvocation is the proof purpose
    for delegations/authorisations - exactly what an IntentMandate is.
    AchievementCredential uses assertionMethod because it ASSERTS facts;
    IntentMandate DELEGATES authority. Different semantics, different
    purpose value.

W3C VC Data Integrity 1.0 conformance (T-1.1 / Voss V-1, V-9):
    The signature covers BOTH the document AND the proof options
    (everything in the proof block minus proofValue), per §4.3 of
    the Data Integrity spec. verificationMethod uses the did:key
    multibase fragment, not the raw pubkey hex. This is a BREAKING
    wire change vs the v0.9.x scheme - old signatures will not
    verify under v0.10 code.

Voss-review fixes landed in this revision:
    - constraints fields are now REQUIRED, not optional
    - Decimal rejects NaN/Infinity/scientific/whitespace
    - mandate.issuer == None no longer crashes verify
    - VerifyResult NamedTuple preserves tuple API but bool() returns ok
    - verify raises (not returns False) when crypto libs unavailable
    - intent_expiry_status() distinguishes malformed from expired
    - intent_id keeps full 128 bit UUID
    - context/type constants are Final tuples
    - validUntil > issuanceDate is enforced at build time
    - did:key length is bounded
    - re-signing is rejected
    - verify failures are logged structurally

    Parameters
    ----------
    issuer_did
        did:key of the authoriser (the DAO or a human user). Must verify
        against the signing identity later in ``sign_intent_mandate``.
    agent_did
        did:key of the agent that's authorised to act under this
        mandate. Becomes ``credentialSubject.id`` per W3C VC convention.
    purpose
        Human-readable phrase describing what the agent may do
        ("buy code review", "pay for compute", "deploy fix").
    constraints
        REQUIRED dict carrying:
          max_amount: {"value": "<finite positive decimal>",
                       "currency": "<3-8 uppercase letters>"}
          allowed_counterparties: list of did:key strings; empty

          allowed_settlement_methods: list of "<adapter>:<asset>"
            tokens; empty list = fail-closed (NO method allowed).
        All three keys are REQUIRED. Missing them previously produced
        a fail-open authorisation, which Voss flagged as P0 (V-2/V-3).
    expires_at
        ISO-8601 timestamp with timezone marker. Becomes ``validUntil``.
        Must be strictly after the (computed) ``issuanceDate`` and
        within ``_MAX_VALIDITY`` of it.
    intent_id
        Optional 32-hex unique id; auto-generated when omitted. The
        full UUID4 is used (not truncated) to keep 122 bits of entropy
        (Voss V-10).
    issued_at
        Optional issuance time; defaults to ``datetime.now(UTC)``.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        On any structural validation failure - we'd rather fail at
