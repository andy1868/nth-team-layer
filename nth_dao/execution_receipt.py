"""Signed execution receipts — L1-1 work-proof primitive (2026-06-08).

Strategic alignment: this module implements the wire format and
signing rules of motebit's ``execution-ledger@1.0`` spec
(motebit/motebit ``spec/execution-ledger-v1.md``) so a receipt
produced by an NTH DAO node verifies against any motebit consumer,
and vice versa. The goal: "工作量证明" — a third party can verify
that this agent really did the work it claims, without trusting NTH's
filesystem or even talking to the NTH node again.

Why a NEW module rather than extending ``nth_dao/agent_ledger.py``:
  * agent_ledger is long-lived per-agent reputation accumulation
    (jsonl append, fingerprint-scoped, reducer-based stats)
  * an execution receipt is a per-GOAL atomic, signed artifact —
    one document per finished execution, not a stream
  * the canonicalization rules + signing input differ (motebit
    requires a very specific newline-joined per-entry canonical
    form that agent_ledger doesn't speak)

Conflating them would either pollute agent_ledger's reducer or
sacrifice motebit interop. Keep separate; they CAN cite each other
later (e.g. agent_ledger could record "completed receipt X" pointers).

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Motebit execution-ledger@1.0 wire format (quoted from spec §5–§6)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Per-entry canonical JSON:
  * keys sorted lexicographically
  * no whitespace (no spaces after ``:`` or ``,``)
  * all three fields present (payload, timestamp, type)
  * nested objects also sorted

Example entry (verbatim from spec):
  {"payload":{"goal_id":"goal-01","prompt":"Search for flights"},"timestamp":1710288000000,"type":"goal_started"}

Content hash:
  1. Canonicalize each entry individually
  2. Join with ``\\n`` (U+000A)
  3. SHA-256 over the resulting UTF-8 bytes
  4. Encode as lowercase hex (64 chars)

Signature:
  * ``signature = Ed25519_Sign(content_hash_bytes, private_key)``
  * **Signed payload is the 32-byte raw hash digest**, NOT its hex
    representation. Implementers who sign the hex string by mistake
    produce signatures that no motebit verifier will accept.
  * Encoded as base64url (RFC 4648 §5, no padding) — alphabet uses
    ``-`` and ``_`` instead of ``+`` and ``/``

Timestamps:
  * Integer milliseconds since Unix epoch (NOT float seconds)
  * Verified against the spec example: ``1710288000000``

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
NTH envelope on top of motebit's signed core
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

A motebit receipt = ``content_hash`` + ``signature`` + ``timeline``.
We wrap that core in an outer NTH envelope so an NTH-only consumer
gets discovery metadata (kind, receipt_id, signer DID) without
needing a separate index:

    {
      "kind": "nth-execution-receipt-v1",
      "compatible_with": "motebit/execution-ledger@1.0",
      "receipt_id": "<uuid>",
      "goal_id": "<caller-supplied>",
      "signer_did": "did:key:z…",
      "signer_pubkey_hex": "<64 hex>",
      "issued_at": "<ISO, display only>",

      # ── motebit core (these are what get verified) ────────────
      "timeline": [<entry>, …],
      "content_hash": "<64 hex>",
      "sig": "<base64url>"
    }

The envelope fields (kind, receipt_id, goal_id, signer_did,
signer_pubkey_hex, issued_at) are NOT covered by ``sig``. They are
discovery metadata only. The signature covers ``content_hash``, and
``content_hash`` covers ``timeline`` — together they bind the agent
to its claimed execution history. An attacker who edits ``timeline``
invalidates the hash; one who edits ``content_hash`` invalidates the
sig; one who edits envelope fields is just lying about discovery
metadata, which is the consumer's responsibility to cross-check
(e.g. via the DID's published identity card).

    Args:
        timeline: ordered list of ``TimelineEntry`` rows. Caller is
            responsible for ordering — typically by ``timestamp``.
            The spec says "Entries with equal timestamps MUST preserve
            insertion order" so we trust the caller's list order
            after the timestamp sort.
        identity: the signing ``AgentIdentity``. Must have a private
            key (``identity.can_sign``); raises if not.
        goal_id: caller-supplied opaque ID linking this receipt to
            the goal/mission/task it terminates. Empty string is OK
            for ad-hoc receipts.
        receipt_id: caller-supplied UUID. If empty, a fresh uuid4 is

            covered by ``sig``.
        prev_content_hash: Phase B (chain link, DESIGN_TRADE_OFFS §1

            entry is **prepended** to the timeline carrying this
            value in its payload. Because the prepended entry
            participates in ``_hash_and_dicts``, it ends up signed.
            Empty string = genesis receipt (no prior receipt for
            this signer).
        authorizing_cap_token: C2 (DESIGN_TRADE_OFFS §2). When
            present, the signing identity is interpreted as an
            **ephemeral delegated subject**, and ``verify_receipt``
            walks the cap_token chain back to the issuer's root

            ``subject_did``, include ``nth:receipt_sign`` in
            capabilities, and have ``not_after >= issued_at``.
            Implementation only attaches the field; semantic
            validation is the verifier's job.

    Returns:
        A dict matching the NTH-execution-receipt-v1 envelope (see
