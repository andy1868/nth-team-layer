"""Architect audit M-3 (2026-06-07): agent_card_from removes non-spec
top-level ``id`` field.

The A2A v0.3.0 Agent Card schema identifies an agent by its ``url``
field. There is no canonical top-level ``id`` field. The sibling
``build_agent_card`` builder (which is the test-covered canonical
path) agrees - it never adds ``id``.

A previous revision added ``"id": agent_did`` to ``agent_card_from``.
Spec-strict A2A clients would flag the card as carrying an undefined
property; some validators (depending on JSON-schema mode) would
reject the whole document.

This pins:
  * agent_card_from does NOT emit a top-level ``id`` key
  * The DID is still discoverable inside ``x-nth-dao.agent_did``
    (vendor extensions are explicitly allowed by the spec)
  * Field set matches the canonical build_agent_card output (with the
    expected ``x-nth-dao`` / ``metadata`` additions only)
