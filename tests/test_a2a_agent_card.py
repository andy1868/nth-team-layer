"""A2A Protocol AgentCard emission at /.well-known/agent.json
(2026-06-08, L0-2 in the NTH DAO roadmap).

What this suite proves:

  1. The endpoint exists at the A2A-canonical path and is reachable
     WITHOUT console auth — same fail-closed contract as the
     NTH-native /.well-known/nth-dao/identity.json.

  2. The emitted JSON conforms to the A2A AgentCard schema (canonical
     definition: a2aproject/A2A specification/a2a.proto):
       * REQUIRED top-level fields are all present
       * supported_interfaces[] entries carry the REQUIRED tuple
         (url, protocol_binding, protocol_version)
       * skills[] entries carry the REQUIRED (id, name, description,
         tags) tuple

  3. The signature envelope is JWS-EdDSA detached-payload format
     (RFC 7515 + RFC 8037) and verifies against the same Ed25519
     pubkey that signs the native card. That cross-card consistency
     is the WHOLE POINT of emitting both — a consumer who trusts the
     pubkey from one channel can verify the other without an extra
     pubkey exchange.

  4. The native NTH card carries an ``a2a_card_url`` cross-link, so a
     consumer that only finds one endpoint can discover the other
     without a second well-known probe.

  5. Tampering invalidates the JWS signature (negative path).

  6. 503 fail-closed when identity material is unavailable, identical
     contract to the native card.
