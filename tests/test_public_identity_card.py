"""Public identity card endpoint (2026-06-08).

``/.well-known/nth-dao/identity.json`` is the unauthenticated public
face of an NTH DAO node. Other NTH DAO downloads scanning the LAN
fetch it to learn how to address us by DID. Strict requirements:

  * unauthenticated - works without console token
  * signed - consumer can verify the response actually came from
    the claimed DID's keypair, defeating a man-in-the-middle on the
    HTTP layer
  * stable schema - the ``kind`` field is the schema tag so future
    revisions don't silently break legacy consumers
