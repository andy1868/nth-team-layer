# Changelog

All notable changes to **NTH DAO** will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.10.0b1] - 2026-06-07 - Beta release: signed mandates, A2A server, hardened collaboration runtime

This beta is the first v0.10 preview. It is intended for testers and
early integrators, not yet for a stable production deployment.

### Added

- Signed mandate primitives: `IntentMandate`, `CartMandate`, and
  `PaymentMandate`, with Data Integrity style proof helpers and
  conformance vectors.
- Mandate EventBus event builders and a web console mandate sidebar.
- A2A boundary server and Agent Card helpers for JSON-RPC style task
  lookup and capability discovery.
- Hardened action routing with explicit pubkey lookup, signed request /
  response handling, TTL and persistent nonce replay protection.
- EventBus correction events, event subscriptions, and fault isolation
  integration with signed audit events.
- Agent daemon support for background group-channel polling and replies.
- Browser-side Ed25519 wallet helper and frontend Vitest coverage for
  mandate UI verification.

### Fixed

- Canonical JSON and identity signing audit gaps, including stricter
  numeric handling and key consistency checks.
- Safer append-only JSONL writes and lock-timeout behavior for
  concurrent local-first operation.
- Web rate limiting and timing-floor behavior around sensitive mandate
  store routes.
- Packaging now includes newly added `nth_dao.mandate` modules and the
  required `team_layer` runtime packages.

### Validation

- Python test suite: 1067 passed, 11 skipped.
- Frontend Vitest suite: 2 passed.
- Frontend production build: passed.
- Pre-release secret/runtime scan: required before every commit, push,
  and release.

## [0.9.6] — 2026-06-02 — Unique group names, governance votes, QQ-style UI

User-facing layer: workspace-unique groups with policy votes, plus the
TS panels for QQ/WeChat-style "find / add / nearby / group" UX. No
breaking changes to existing protocol artifacts.

### Added — GroupRegistry (Python, protocol)

- `nth_dao/group_registry.py` — workspace-unique groups.
  - `normalize_group_name(name)` produces a stable slug
    (`Frontend Team!` → `frontend-team`).
  - `GroupRecord` is signed by the founder; subsequent updates re-sign.
  - `GroupPolicy` enum: `open` / `approval` / `closed` / `voted`.
  - `GroupRegistry.publish()` enforces slug uniqueness — same group_id
    re-publish updates; different group_id reusing the slug raises
    `GroupRegistryError`.
  - `search()` is fuzzy-match across slug / display_name / description.
- **Governance voting** — `PolicyChangeProposal`, signed by a member.
  Members append signed `Vote` records; `resolve_proposal` returns
  passed/reason. Threshold: `> 50%` of current member pubkeys, deduped.
  `apply_proposal` builds a new GroupRecord re-signed by an admin.
- Anti-DoS: non-member proposer rejected; duplicate yes-votes from same
  pubkey deduped; tampered proposer signatures rejected.

### Added — Web API (Python, FastAPI)

In `nth_dao/web/`, 14 new endpoints:

- `GET  /api/agents/search?q=` — QQ-style fuzzy search over
  `PeerFinder` (matches agent_id, label from registry metadata,
  capabilities, groups; ranked).
- `POST /api/agents/lan_discover` — server-initiated UDP LAN scan,
  returns LANPeers with `ws_url` and `pubkey_hex`.
- `POST /api/agents/add` — add an agent by `target_agent_id` OR
  `target_did` (W3C did:key resolved server-side).
- `POST /api/groups/registry` — prepare unsigned group skeleton.
- `POST /api/groups/registry/publish` — persist a signed GroupRecord.
- `GET  /api/groups/registry` — list all.
- `POST /api/groups/registry/search` — fuzzy search.
- `POST /api/groups/registry/{group_id}/proposals` — prepare unsigned
  proposal skeleton.
- `POST /api/groups/registry/{group_id}/proposals/publish` — submit a
  signed proposal.
- `GET  /api/groups/registry/{group_id}/proposals` — list proposals
  with resolution status.
- `POST /api/groups/registry/{group_id}/proposals/{proposal_id}/sign_vote`
  — append a signed vote and re-resolve.

All write endpoints follow the same "server prepares unsigned skeleton →
client signs locally → client posts back" pattern so private keys never
touch the wire.

### Added — TS panels (frontend/src/panels/, per the iron rule)

Four QQ/WeChat-inspired React panels + a shell that ties them together:

- `ContactsPanel` — search by name/label/capability, "+ Add" buttons,
  fallback "exact agent_id / DID" form.
- `NearbyPanel` — "people nearby" LAN discovery, with optional PSK.
- `GroupsPanel` — list / search / create unique groups. Shows policy
  color band per group; the "create" form lets the user pick the
  initial policy.
- `GovernancePanel` — propose a policy change with rationale; vote
  yes/no/abstain on open proposals.
- `ContactShell` — top tab bar with the four panels, browse-only mode
  when no wallet is connected.
- `qq-style.css` — standalone styles so existing `styles.css` is
  untouched.

The host app supplies `actorPubkeyHex` and `sign(payload)` (browser
wallet of any flavor). When omitted, the panels render but signing-
required actions are disabled and labeled.

### Tests

- 238 passing + 5 skipped (was 217 + 5).
- 21 new tests in `tests/test_v096_group_registry_and_web.py`:
  slug normalization, slug-collision rejection, search ranking,
  proposal pass/fail with majority/below-threshold, non-member
  proposer rejection, double-yes dedup, tampered proposer sig
  rejection; plus a FastAPI TestClient pass over each new endpoint.

### No protocol changes on disk

`Mission`, `MissionTemplate`, `TeamConfig`, `GuardianSet`, `Endorsement`,
`Invitation`, gossip envelope — all unchanged. GroupRecord is a brand-new
artifact stored under `team_groups/` next to existing files.

## [0.9.5] — 2026-05-31 — DID:key, AgentLedger, Guardian recovery, A2A boundary

Five additive deliverables, no breaking changes. v0.9.4 artifacts load
byte-identically.

### Added — W3C did:key standard alignment

- `nth_dao/did_key.py` — pure-stdlib base58btc + multicodec (0xed 0x01)
  encode/decode of Ed25519 pubkeys per W3C did:key spec.
- `AgentIdentity.as_did()` — emits a full `did:key:z…` string. Replaces
  the v0.9.3 simplified placeholder.
- `AgentIdentity.from_did(did)` — rebuilds a verify-only identity from
  a DID. Useful for trusting a peer by their DID without their private key.
- `MissionTemplate.publisher_did` is now a real did:key (previously
  a truncated-hex placeholder).

### Added — AgentLedger persistence

- `nth_dao/agent_ledger.py` — per-pubkey-fingerprint append-only event
  ledger. Stored at `sidechain/agents/<fp>/{profile.json, ledger.jsonl,
  stats.json}`. Same anti-Sybil pattern as reputation credits: one
  pubkey = one ledger regardless of how many agent_ids it uses.
- Event types: step claim / complete / failed, handoff (given +
  received), review given / received, endorsement given / received,
  mission owned.
- Deterministic reducer (`compute_stats`) folds events into
  `{missions_owned, steps_completed, success_rate, handoffs_*,
  templates_used, categories, total_token_cost, last_active_at}`.
  A Rust/Go port walking the same JSONL produces the same dict.
- Events are signed when a crypto identity is available; unsigned
  events still count (best-effort signing per Sec model).

### Added — Guardian-based social recovery

- `nth_dao/guardian.py` — N-of-M threshold recovery. The agent publishes
  a signed `GuardianSet(guardian_pubkeys, threshold)`. To replace a key,
  the agent assembles a `KeyReplacementProof` and collects M guardian
  signatures over its canonical payload.
- `verify_replacement(proof, guardian_set)` validates:
  - guardian_set itself signed by the protected pubkey,
  - proof references the right set_id + fingerprint,
  - ≥ threshold distinct valid signatures from guardian pubkeys.
- `GuardianStore` persists sets + proofs under `team_recovery/` and
  maintains `active_replacements.json` for `resolve_current_pubkey(fp)`
  queries. Other components can use that to follow key rotations.
- The protected pubkey MUST NOT appear in its own guardian set;
  duplicate signatures de-duplicated; mallory's signature ignored
  when she isn't in the set.

### Added — A2A boundary translation primitives

- `nth_dao/a2a/translate.py` — pure data transformations between our
  types and Google Agent2Agent (A2A) shapes.
- `template_to_a2a_skill(template)` — render a MissionTemplate as an
  A2A Skill (with JSON-Schema input/output specs derived from IOField).
- `agent_card_from(...)` — assemble an A2A AgentCard JSON dict
  suitable for `/.well-known/agent.json`.
- `a2a_task_from_mission(mission)` — render a Mission as an A2A Task
  (status mapped: planning → submitted, active → in_progress, …).
- `mission_inputs_from_a2a_message(message, template)` — extract +
  validate structured inputs from an A2A SendMessage payload.
- **No HTTP / no JSON-RPC**: those land in a separate package
  (`nth-dao-a2a-adapter`, v0.10.0). The protocol core stays stdlib-only.

### Added — wire-format conformance vectors expanded

- `nth_dao/conformance/vectors.json` grew from 22 vectors / 6 categories
  to **31 vectors / 11 categories**.
- New categories: `channel_message_canonical` (2),
  `invitation_canonical` (1), `team_config_canonical` (1),
  `did_key_encoding` (3), `lan_psk_tag` (2).
- A non-Python implementation passing all 31 vectors is now wire-compatible
  for the full Layer 1-2 protocol surface (modulo replay-window timing).

### Tests

- 217 passing + 5 skipped (was 169 + 1). +48 new tests:
  - `tests/test_did_key.py` — 16 (round-trip, error paths, AgentIdentity
    integration, template.publisher_did upgrade).
  - `tests/test_v095_features.py` — 25 (AgentLedger fold, scoping,
    handoff counters, Guardian set / replacement valid + below-threshold
    + non-guardian + duplicate + tampered, GuardianStore commit /
    resolve, A2A skill / card / task / inputs).
  - Conformance vectors: 5 → 5 (test count unchanged but covers 31 vectors).
- All 169 v0.9.4 tests still pass; no behavior regression.

### No protocol changes on disk

`Mission`, `MissionTemplate`, `TeamConfig`, `Endorsement`, `Invitation`,
gossip envelope — all unchanged. The `publisher_did` field that already
existed since v0.9.3 just contains a more useful value now.

## [0.9.4] — 2026-05-31 — Sustainability sprint

This release does NOT add new protocol surface. It fills six holes the
v0.9.1 code review identified as preventing the project from outliving its
single maintainer:

### Added — SECURITY.md + key recovery

- `SECURITY.md` — supported versions, disclosure address, threat model
  (what we defend against + what we explicitly don't), per-vulnerability
  history.
- `nth_dao/key_recovery.py` — passphrase-protected `RecoveryKit` for
  exporting / re-importing an `AgentIdentity`. Uses libsodium
  `crypto_secretbox` (XSalsa20 + Poly1305) with Argon2id key derivation
  at INTERACTIVE difficulty (~0.5s per try). Rejects tampered kits;
  rejects wrong passwords without revealing whether the kit format itself
  is valid.
- 14 tests in `tests/test_key_recovery.py`.

### Added — docs/MIGRATIONS.md + migration test runner

- `docs/MIGRATIONS.md` — forward-compat policy for 0.9.x, per-version
  delta, contributor rule that all new fields default-init safely.
- `tests/test_migrations.py` + `tests/migration_fixtures/0.9.0/`
  fixtures — a v0.9.0 mission and team.json file. The runner asserts
  current code parses them cleanly and preserves the originally-set
  fields. Unknown fields are tolerated.
- 4 tests confirm round-trip integrity through the current code.

### Added — nth-status + nth-metrics CLI

- `nth_dao/cli/status.py` — text or JSON snapshot of a workspace.
  Sections: version, team, agents (alive vs registered), missions
  (by status + archived count), templates (total + deprecated +
  reviews), trust (anchors, endorsements, revocations).
- `nth_dao/cli/metrics.py` — Prometheus exposition-format `/metrics`
  endpoint, served by the stdlib `ThreadingHTTPServer`. Each metric is
  a gauge with HELP + TYPE comments. Includes `/healthz`. Pure stdlib —
  no `prometheus_client` dependency.
- New console scripts: `nth-status`, `nth-metrics`.
- 12 tests in `tests/test_cli_status_metrics.py` including a smoke test
  that actually starts the HTTP server, scrapes it, and shuts it down.

### Added — requirements.lock files

- `requirements/README.md` — reproducibility rationale + usage.
- `requirements/base.txt` (empty — core is stdlib only).
- `requirements/crypto.lock.txt`, `requirements/ux.lock.txt`,
  `requirements/web.lock.txt`, `requirements/dev.lock.txt` — pinned
  transitive dependency trees for each extra.
- CI hint: rebuild quarterly with `pip-compile`. Between rebuilds the
  locks are immutable.

### Added — conformance test suite

- `nth_dao/conformance/` — vectors-based wire-protocol conformance.
  Vectors are written by `python -m nth_dao.conformance.regenerate` and
  shipped in `nth_dao/conformance/vectors.json`. The reference runner
  in `nth_dao/conformance/runner.py` verifies the Python implementation
  passes its own vectors.
- 22 vectors across 6 categories: `canonical_json`, `fingerprint`,
  `signature_verify`, `endorsement_canonical_payload`,
  `template_canonical_payload`, `replay_window`.
- `docs/CONFORMANCE.md` — contract for non-Python implementations.
  Wire-compatible = zero failures under the equivalent runner.
- 5 tests in `tests/test_conformance.py`.

### Added — A2A alignment report

- `docs/research/A2A_ALIGNMENT.md` — comparison vs Google's Agent2Agent
  protocol (Linux Foundation, Apache 2.0, 150+ orgs, v1.0 in 2026):
  identity, discovery, capability advertisement, task lifecycle,
  transport, trust, streaming, push, auth, marketplace, decentralization.
  Strategic conclusion: our protocol stays distinct (the deep choices
  are not reconcilable), but a v0.10.0+ `nth-dao-a2a-adapter` package
  will translate at the boundary. Adopt A2A vocabulary in user-facing
  docs; code names stay NTH DAO.

### Why these and not AgentLedger / DID:key

The v0.9.3 retrospective ("self-pivoting" 4-question check) identified
that *every* assumption about NTH DAO surviving 12+ months ran through
one of the six holes above:

  R-2 key recovery, R-3 observability, R-4 dep lockfile, R-5 upgrade
  path, M-2 ecosystem alignment, conformance for portability.

`AgentLedger` (history aggregation) and `DID:key` standards-compliance
have value but neither blocks survival. They're moved to v0.9.5.

### Tests

- Total: **169 passing + 1 skipped** (was 138 + 1). +31 tests covering
  the six holes above. No existing test regressed.

### No protocol changes

- `MissionTemplate`, `Mission`, `TeamConfig`, `Endorsement`, `Revocation`,
  `Invitation`, gossip envelope, LAN discovery — **all unchanged on disk
  and on the wire**. v0.9.3 artifacts are byte-identical to v0.9.4
  artifacts when produced by the same code path.

## [0.9.3] — 2026-05-31 — Mission templates: "decentralized App Store" layer

This release lifts MissionStore from a one-shot quest board into a reusable,
signed, rateable template registry. Aligned with cargo-crev / F-Droid / TUF /
Argo / GitHub Actions / Nix flake.lock — zero new runtime dependencies.

### Added — MissionTemplate (Layer 2)

- **`nth_dao/orchestration/template.py`** — `MissionTemplate` dataclass,
  `TemplateStore`, `mint_template()` helper, `TemplateType` enum (5 kinds:
  `agent_task`, `agent_chain`, `agent_dag`, `agent_review`, `human_in_loop`).
- **`IOField`** dataclass — `inputs` / `outputs` schema aligned with GitHub
  Actions `action.yml` field naming (description / type / required / default /
  values). Five primitive types: `string`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `enum`.
- **`StepSkeleton`** — step blueprint with `inputs_from` sourcing
  (`"input:NAME"` simple form for v0.9.3).
- **Semver-validated `version`** — re-publishing same `(template_id, version)`
  errors unless `allow_overwrite=True`.
- **Publisher signature mandatory** — `TemplatePublishError` on bad sig
  before persistence.
- **Deprecation** — `templates.deprecate(publisher, id, version, reason)`;
  only the original publisher can deprecate; subsequent `instantiate()` of
  a deprecated template raises `ValueError`.
- **F-Droid/TUF-style derived index** — `_template_index.json` rebuilt on every
  publish with TUF-style `version` monotonic counter, `meta` map, and three
  inverted indexes (`by_category` / `by_publisher` / `by_capability`).

### Added — MissionReview

- **`nth_dao/orchestration/review.py`** — `MissionReview` dataclass,
  `ReviewStore`, `mint_review()` helper, `TemplateStats` aggregator.
- **Signed reviews** — append-only `reviews/<template_id>-v<version>.jsonl`,
  one signed line per review (cargo-crev Proof model).
- **Score range** 0.0–5.0 validated at mint.
- **Self-review rejected** — the mission owner cannot review their own work.
- **Dedup at read** — `only_latest_per_reviewer=True` keeps only the most
  recent rating per `(reviewer_pubkey, mission_id)`; the raw JSONL preserves
  every submission for audit.
- **EWMA aggregation** — `TemplateStats.weighted_average` uses
  α=0.3 EWMA so recent reviews count more without entirely overriding history.

### Added — Mission instance linkage

- `Mission.template_id`, `Mission.template_version` — link an instance to
  its template.
- `Mission.template_lock` — Nix-flake-lock-style snapshot of the publisher
  signature at instantiation time. A later re-publish (or in-place template
  tamper) cannot retroactively change the contract a running mission was
  built under.
- 5 reserved fields with empty defaults for Layer 3 (`owner_did`,
  `legal_jurisdiction`, `governing_arbiter`, `credentials_required`).
  Behavior is still empty; field names are now stable for future use.

### Added — MissionStore APIs

- `publish_template(template, allow_overwrite=False)`
- `list_templates(category=, publisher_pubkey=, required_capabilities=, include_deprecated=)`
- `browse_templates(category=, tags=, min_average_rating=, sort_by="rating"|"recent"|"popularity", limit=, include_deprecated=)`
- `instantiate(template_id, version=None, *, owner, inputs={}, scope, priority, title, goal)` — version omitted picks latest
- `review_mission(mission_id, reviewer, score, feedback)`
- `template_stats(template_id, version=None)`
- `archive_completed(older_than_days=30)` — atomic move of terminal missions to `archive/YYYY-MM/`
- `list_archive(year_month=None)` — read archived missions
- `my_history(agent_id, since=, include_archive=True, limit=)` — personal contribution view

### Added — language iron rule

`CONTRIBUTING.md` Hard Rules now includes a non-negotiable language-choice
rule: **TypeScript for UI / dashboards / browser extensions; Python for the
core protocol layer and everything else**. Different cadences want different
toolchains. UI changes weekly, protocol changes yearly.

### Added — docs

- **`docs/PROTOCOLS.md §9`** — full wire-format spec for MissionTemplate,
  MissionReview, derived index, mission template lock, archive layout, and
  the 5 Layer-3 reserved fields. Documents alignment with 7 industry
  standards.
- **`docs/CATEGORIES.md`** — recommended bootstrap taxonomy (Tier 1: 10
  well-known categories; Tier 2: emerging; Tier 3: discouraged).

### Tests

- 30 new tests in `tests/test_p7_template_review.py` covering mint /
  publish round-trip / tamper / semver / deprecation / instantiation /
  template_lock / latest-version selection / review signing / dedup /
  EWMA aggregation / browse sort orders / archive + history.
- Total test count now: **138 + 1 skipped** (was 102).
- `examples/template_demo.py` end-to-end walk-through.

### Aligned with (not depended on)

- cargo-crev — Proof model (sign-by-author, append-only, P2P)
- F-Droid metadata — one file per template + derived index
- TUF — `version` monotonic, `meta` field name, `delegations` placeholder
- Argo WorkflowTemplate — 5-value `template_type`
- GitHub Actions `action.yml` — input/output schema field naming
- Nix `flake.lock` — `template_lock` snapshot on instantiation
- W3C `did:key` — `publisher_did` field (simplified placeholder)

## [0.9.2] — 2026-05-31 — Revocation, invitations, LAN privacy, protocol spec

### Added — P6 follow-on roadmap items

- **Endorsement revocation** (`web_of_trust.py`):
  - New `Revocation` dataclass — owner-signed cancellation tied to a specific
    `(endorser, subject, issued_at)` triple.
  - `issue_revocation(endorser, endorsement, reason)` mints + signs.
  - `TrustGraph.revoke()` issues + imports in one call;
    `TrustGraph.import_revocation()` validates signature, requires a
    matching endorsement on disk (prevents pre-emptive DoS revocations),
    and dedupes.
  - `_load_all()` now filters out revoked endorsements; chains break
    immediately. Persisted at `team_trust/revocations.jsonl`.
- **Invitation tokens** (`nth_dao/invitation.py`):
  - New `Invitation` dataclass that bundles `team_id` + `owner_pubkey` +
    `join_token` + optional `ws_url` + optional LAN `psk`, signed by owner.
  - `Invitation.mint(team_config, owner_identity, ...)` — fails fast if the
    minting identity doesn't match `team_config.owner_pubkey`.
  - URL form: `nthdao+invite://<base64url payload>`, ≤ 2 KB so it fits
    inside one QR code.
  - `to_qr_terminal()` (qrcode lib only) and `to_qr_png()` (`pip install
    nth-dao[ux]`) render the URL as ASCII / PNG QR code.
  - `Invitation.from_url()` + `validate()` reject expired/tampered/wrong-scheme.
- **LAN discovery privacy** (`discovery/lan.py`):
  - New `psk=` argument on `LANDiscovery`. Both query and hello carry an
    `HMAC-SHA256(psk, nonce)` tag; responder only answers queries with
    matching tag, querier only accepts hellos with matching tag.
    `hmac.compare_digest` used throughout.
  - Empty `psk` = open mode (unchanged behavior, backward compatible).
- **`docs/PROTOCOLS.md`** — 350-line wire-protocol spec covering identity,
  gossip handshake + envelope, endorsements / revocations, signed team
  config, invitations, LAN discovery, marketplace orders, missions. Enables
  Rust / Go / TypeScript implementations to interop with the Python reference.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** "Hard Rules" section documents the eight enforcement
  rules learned from the v0.9.1 review (file I/O via util, signed wire
  protocols, CAS for concurrency, no `except: pass`, etc.).

### Added — extras

- `[lan]` extra: `zeroconf>=0.131` (placeholder for v0.9.3 mDNS backend).
- `[ux]` extra: `qrcode[pil]>=7.4` for invitation QR rendering.

### Tests

- 19 new tests in `tests/test_p6_revoke_psk_invite.py`:
  - revocation round-trip, wrong-issuer rejection, immediate de-trust,
    cross-instance persistence, pre-emptive revocation drop,
    tampered-signature drop;
  - LAN PSK: blocks unauth queries, allows matching, rejects wrong PSK,
    backward-compat open mode;
  - Invitation: mint round-trip, validation, tamper rejection, expiry,
    non-owner mint rejection, wrong-scheme / garbage URL rejection, QR
    terminal rendering, helpful ImportError without extra.
- Total test count now: **102 + 1 skip** (was 83).

## [0.9.1] — 2026-05-31 — P0/P1 security & correctness review fixes

### Security
- **Gossip signature verification fixed**: messages are now verified against the *author's* trusted pubkey (not the relay peer's). Unsigned or mismatched messages are **dropped**, not silently accepted as before. A 10-minute replay window is enforced. `require_signature=True` is the new default.
- **WebSocket challenge-response handshake**: peers must prove possession of their declared pubkey (sign a server-issued nonce) before being added to the peer table. `GossipNode.trust_agent()` + `trusted_pubkeys=` constructor arg manage the trust anchor map; pubkey rotation triggers a `logger.warning`.
- **Atomic mission claim**: `MissionStore.try_claim()` uses cross-process file locks (POSIX `fcntl` / Windows `msvcrt`) plus compare-and-swap, raising `ClaimConflict` when another agent already owns the step. Includes a 6-process race test (`tests/test_concurrent_claim.py`) proving exactly-once semantics.
- **Mission FAILED terminal state**: missions with a failed step and no remaining actionable steps now transition to `FAILED` (previously hung in `ACTIVE` forever).
- **Constant-time join-token comparison**: `MembershipManager` uses `hmac.compare_digest`, preventing timing side-channels.
- **Private key file ACL on Windows**: `AgentIdentity.save()` tightens ACL via `icacls /grant ... /inheritance:r` with a post-write read self-check. Failures emit `logger.warning` instead of `except: pass` leaving keys world-readable.
- **Identity tamper detection**: `AgentIdentity.load()` derives the pubkey from the private key and refuses to load when the stored pubkey disagrees.

### Fixed
- Marketplace `reject()` now notifies the original claimant (replaced broken `hasattr('claimant_history')` always-False check that DMed `"unknown"`).
- Marketplace credits go through `_transfer_credits()` + append-only `*_credits.ledger.jsonl`, with insufficient-balance checks preventing local double-spend.
- Reputation `rate()` validates score range, rejects self-rating, supports `upsert=True` (replace latest), and rate-limits non-upsert calls per `(rater, subject, context)`.
- Reputation `get_all_scores()` / `top_agents()` reuse a single `_load_all()` pass (was O(N²)).
- Channel `fetch()` merges across files by timestamp before slicing `limit` (previously returned host-grouped, mis-ordered results, and `since_msg_id` could miss messages across files).
- Mission `update_step` no longer double-pushes `previous_assignees` when changing status+assignee in one call.
- `Mission.updated_at` is actually bumped on save (was a self-assignment no-op).
- `Mission.from_dict` no longer mutates the caller's dict via `data.pop`.
- `MissionRunner.handoff()` rejects empty targets, self-handoffs, and (when a registry is provided) dead targets.
- `PeerFinder.rank()` adds `min_match` parameter; the old `min_score=0.5` floor returned agents with 0 matching capabilities.
- `AgentRegistry.register()` registers `atexit` only once per instance instead of stacking callbacks across re-attaches.
- `attach()` does the membership check *before* creating the backend, preventing subprocess leaks on join failure; `detach()` calls backend `close/stop/shutdown` if available.
- Gossip `_recv_loop` no longer updates `last_seen` on a throwaway `PeerInfo` object (was a silent no-op).
- Channel `stats()` no longer reuses `_` as both iteration variable and filter predicate.

### Changed
- New `nth_dao/util/io.py` centralises `safe_id`, `atomic_write_json`, `atomic_write_text`, `safe_load_json`, and `InterProcessLock`. Six modules that previously copy-pasted `_safe_id` and atomic-write logic now share this util.
- `__version__` reads from `importlib.metadata` so it stays in sync with `pyproject.toml`.
- `groups.Channel` re-exported as `GroupChannel` alias to disambiguate from `channel.TeamChannel`.

### Added (tests)
- 20 new regression tests in `tests/test_p0_fixes.py` covering atomic claim CAS, mission FAILED state machine, identity tamper rejection, reputation rate-limits / upsert / anti-Sybil credits, marketplace double-spend prevention, channel fetch global sort, peer finder min_match, and handoff alive-check.
- Cross-process race test `tests/test_concurrent_claim.py` (spawn 6 workers → exactly 1 winner, 5 ClaimConflict).
- Total test count: 45 (up from 23).

### P5 — "People nearby" discovery (WeChat-style find-and-meet)

- **Fuzzy `PeerFinder.search(query)`** — substring / prefix / exact-match scoring across `agent_id`, `label` (extracted from `metadata["identity"]["label"]`), `capabilities`, and `groups`. Returns `MatchResult` list ranked by score, with `+0.5` idle bonus and configurable `limit` / `min_score` / `exclude_agent_ids` / `fields`. 10 new regression tests covering each scoring rule, label extraction, idle tie-breaking, self-exclusion, and limit.
- **`nth_dao/discovery/lan.py`** — zero-config UDP-based agent discovery on the local subnet. No mDNS / Bonjour, pure stdlib `socket`.
  - `LANDiscovery(agent_id, label, capabilities, ws_url, pubkey_hex, port=9877)` — call `.start()` to spawn a background responder thread that answers query packets that match its capabilities.
  - `LANDiscovery.discover(timeout=3.0, wanted_capabilities=None, target_addrs=None)` — broadcast a query (`255.255.255.255` by default; tests use `127.0.0.1`) and collect `LANPeer` responses for `timeout` seconds. De-duped by agent_id; results carry `ws_url` so the caller can hand them to `GossipNode.connect()` and `pubkey_hex` so they can be added to `TrustGraph.add_root()`.
  - Context-manager friendly (`with LANDiscovery(...) as lan: ...`).
  - Nonce-based response matching so stale replies are dropped.
  - Windows hardening: catches `ConnectionResetError` from ICMP "port unreachable" bleed-through that would otherwise blow up `recvfrom`.
- **`__init__.py` facade exports** `LANDiscovery` + `LANPeer`.
- 7 new LAN tests covering: peer found, capability filter, self-exclusion (loopback), empty result when nobody's listening, stale-nonce rejection, facade exports, context manager lifecycle.
- Total test count now: **83** (up from 66).

### P4 — Web-of-Trust: endorsement-based multi-hop trust

- **New module `nth_dao/web_of_trust.py`** with `Endorsement` dataclass, `TrustGraph` resolver, and `issue_endorsement()` helper.
- An `Endorsement` is a signed `{endorser_pubkey, subject_pubkey, subject_agent_id, depth_allowed, context, issued_at, expires_at, sig}` payload. `endorser.sign_json(endorsement.signable_dict())` produces the signature.
- `TrustGraph` stores root anchors in `team_trust/roots.json` and endorsements append-only in `team_trust/endorsements.jsonl`. `is_trusted(agent_id, pubkey, max_depth=2)` runs a bounded BFS, verifying the signature chain and respecting each endorser's `depth_allowed` cap.
- `GossipNode(..., trust_graph=..., wot_max_depth=2)` now falls back to the trust graph when an author's pubkey isn't directly pinned. Log lines tag whether trust came from `pinned` or `wot`.
- **Hop budget enforced correctly**: an endorsement with `depth_allowed=1` makes the subject a *leaf* — their own endorsements won't propagate further. Verified by `test_depth_allowed_caps_propagation`.
- 16 new tests in `tests/test_web_of_trust.py` covering: round-trip + sig verify, tampered endorsement, root direct trust, agent_id spoof rejection, 1-hop / 2-hop chains, expired endorsements, wrong-signer endorsements, `resolve_path` returns full chain, depth_allowed cap, invalid depth at issue, `trusted_pubkey_for` lookup, cross-instance persistence, facade re-exports, and gossip integration.
- Total test count now: **66** (up from 50).

### P3 — anti-tamper hardening

- **Signed team config (anti git-sync poisoning)**: `TeamConfig` gains `owner_pubkey` + `owner_sig` + `sig_updated_at` fields. When `MembershipManager` is constructed with an `owner_identity` that holds Ed25519 keys, every `save_config()` signs the canonical config. `load_config()` rejects (returns empty `TeamConfig()`) any signed file whose signature doesn't verify against its pinned `owner_pubkey` — meaning a malicious node can't `git push` a tampered `team.json` that adds themselves as admin.
- `MembershipManager.enable_signed_owner(identity, actor_id)` — admin-gated upgrade path to turn signing on for an existing unsigned team.
- `init_team(..., owner_identity=...)` — bootstrap a fresh team with owner signing in one shot.
- `attach()` auto-detects whether the agent is the legitimate owner (its pubkey matches the file's `owner_pubkey`) and only then activates owner-signing for that session — non-owner attaches read-only verify.
- **Reputation credits scoped by pubkey fingerprint**: when an `AgentIdentity` with crypto is passed, the anti-Sybil credit file uses `identity.fingerprint()[:16]` rather than `safe_id(agent_id)`. An attacker spawning 1000 `agent_id`s now still shares 5 starting credits per unique keypair (instead of 5 × 1000); legitimate single-keypair-multi-agent_id setups now correctly share one credit pool.

### P2 polish
- **Anti-Sybil rating credits** in `ReputationManager`: each new (non-upsert) `rate()` costs 1 credit; initial balance 5, daily refill +3 (cap 30). `rep.credits()` exposes current balance. Combined with the (rater, subject, context) rate-limit, this makes mass-rating costly without needing a global ledger.
- **Backend resource release**: `attach.detach()` now uses an explicit `_close_backend()` helper that probes `close` → `stop` → `shutdown` (in that priority order) and logs at debug when none exist.
- **Docstring de-mojibake**: replaced encoding-corrupted Chinese comments / docstrings in `nth_dao/__init__.py`, `nth_dao/attach.py`, `nth_dao/discovery/agent_registry.py`, `nth_dao/orchestration/mission.py`, `nth_dao/orchestration/mission_store.py`, and `nth_dao/orchestration/mission_runner.py` with English equivalents that match the actual behavior. (The old files contained `""`-only docstrings after the encoding loss.)
- `AgentRecord.short()` no longer uses empty strings as alive/dead markers (replaced with `*`/`-`).
- `agent_registry` heartbeat-tick failure is now logged at debug instead of silently swallowed.
